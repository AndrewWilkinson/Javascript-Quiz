# Javascript-Quiz
A Quiz using only Bootstrap and basic javascript

Allows usage of a basic data file of my own design for any amount of quiz questions. Two examples provided.

Offers selection of how many of the give questions to ask.
Navigates back and forth through a portion of the questions provided.
Finally presents a bar chart analysis of your selected question category

Space for improvement:
Randomisation of the order of answers provided in each question could be easily achieved as answer are linked to their relevant category in data.
Randomisation of the order of the questions could be easily achieved, although would add little benefit.
Front-facing question upload/selection method rather than change file path.

Disclaimer: these question were provided for this exercise and I do not endorse their psychoanaylsis.
